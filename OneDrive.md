# OneDrive guidance
This file has proposed guidelines on collaborating through Microsoft OneDrive.

# Directory name
Follow our naming advice for [GitHub repos](https://github.com/AU-BCE-EE/guidance-GitHub/blob/main/repo-creation.md#repo-name). 
Give the shared folder the same name as any related repo or other directories (see [guidance-data-analysis](https://github.com/AU-BCE-EE/guidance-data-analysis/blob/main/README.md)). 
For example: "Johnson-2025-barnacle-emission".

# Guidelines
1. Share a complete folder instead of individual documents. It is easier for collaborators to find and synchronize shared folders, and easier for the owner to add or remove files without changing sharing settings for each individual document.
2. Follow our naming advice for [GitHub repos](https://github.com/AU-BCE-EE/guidance-GitHub/blob/main/repo-creation.md#repo-name). Give the shared folder the same name as any related repo or other directories (see [guidance-data-analysis](https://github.com/AU-BCE-EE/guidance-data-analysis/blob/main/README.md)). For example: "Johnson-2025-barnacle-emission".
3. For names for important files that will be regularly edited (e.g., manuscript docx files) try to use a similar name as the directory name. But flexibility is OK here. The intent is to make it easy for collaborators to find the right file in online, in their local copies, or in their Office program shortcuts. If everyone uses the name "manuscript.docx" than the shortcuts are not very useful. An clearer but still short alternative would be "Johnson-barnacle-manus.docs"
4. Give the required degree of access and not more, i.e., only give write access to those who need to edit your documents or delete or upload files.
5. Try to maintain Microsoft connections to the current file. That means you should avoid replacing important files, like manuscript drafts. If you want save a certain version (beyond OneDrive's automatic version control system), you can copy the document and place the copy in a "Drafts" or similar subdirectory. See the proposed directory structure for manuscripts below.

# Example directory structure for a manuscript
```
Johnson-2025-barnacle-emission
|
|--Johnson-barnacle-manus.docx
|
|--Drafts
|     |--Johnson-barnacle-manus_2025_02_first_shared.docx
|     |--Johnson-barnacle-manus_2025_04_comments.docx
|
|--Submission1
|     |--cover.docx
|     |--submission1.pdf
|     |--fig1.pdf
|     |--Johnson-barnacle-manus.docx
|
|--Submission2
      |--submission2.pdf
      |--fig1.pdf
      |--Johnson-barnacle-manus.docx
      |--response.docx
```

The intent with this approach is that the file "Johnson-barnacle-manus.docx" at the root is the one that should be edited.
Subdirectory or file names can be used to suggest what should not be edited, for example:

```
Johnson-2025-barnacle-emission
|
|--Johnson-barnacle-manus.docx
|
|--Drafts-no-edit
|     |--Johnson-barnacle-manus_2025_02_first_shared.docx
|     |--Johnson-barnacle-manus_2025_04_comments.docx
|
|--Submission1
|     |--cover.docx
|     |--submission1.pdf
|     |--fig1.pdf
|     |--Johnson-barnacle-manus.docx
|
|--Submission2
      |--submission2.pdf
      |--fig1.pdf
      |--Johnson-barnacle-manus.docx
      |--response.docx
```
