# guidance
Guidance or documentation on any software, functions, workflows, or procedures that might be helpful for account members

# Basic approach
Create a separate subdirectory for each topic.
Subdirectories should contain a README.md file and may contain scripts (function definitions or demos), vignettes, data, etc.
