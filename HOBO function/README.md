# HOBO sensor #
This is a function to read the data from the HOBO model MX2301A.

At the moment it works with the `.csv` files. The HOBO file type might follow later.

If you wanna have such a function for your HOBO sensor (different model type), please send me some example files of your sensor and I might be able to include it in the function.

- A (detailed) explanation of the different possible input arguments will follow later
